If you have any questions, please post to the Moodle discussion forum.

#Introduction

Read the instructions in this document carefully.

In this assignment you will solve eight tasks and use a tester to test your code. The tester employs a small number of test cases. Note that we will use additional test cases when marking your assignment submission.

You can download files from Moodle as single zip file: `A1.zip`. Right-click on `A1.zip` and select `Extract Here`. The code for this assignment consists of several files and folders. You should only edit certain files, others should NOT be edited.

##Files you will *edit*, *compile* and *run*:
Filename | Description
---------| ------------
`1.cpp` | Task 1
`2.cpp` | Task 2
`3.cpp` | Task 3
`4.cpp` | Task 4
`5.cpp` | Task 5
`6.cpp` | Task 6
`7.cpp` | Task 7
`8.cpp` | Task 8

##Files you will *compile* and *run*:
Filename           | Description
-------------------| ------------
`test.cpp`  		   | Tester

##Folders

There are three folders. Do not edit any files in these folders. The tester may not work correctly if you edit any files in these folders.

Folder name | Description
------------| ------------
`expectedOutput`| Expected output files
`input`     		| Input files for test cases
`yourOutput`    	| Output files of your program

##Evaluation
Your code will be tested for technical correctness. Please do not edit any provided code in `test.cpp` and do not edit any files in the folders, or you may wreak havoc on the tester. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the tester's judgments -- will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review your work individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.

##Academic Dishonesty
We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class and from the Internet for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don't let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.

##Getting Help
You are not alone! If you find yourself stuck on something, post your question to the course forum. We want this assignment to be rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don't know when or how to help unless you ask.

##Discussion Forum
Please be careful not to post spoilers. Please don't post any code that is directly related to the assignments. However you are welcome and encouraged to discuss general ideas on the discussion forums. If you have any questions about this assignment you should post them in the discussion forums. Do not email individual teachers with questions.

##Submission
Zip `1.cpp`, `2.cpp`, ...,  `8.cpp` to the file `submit.zip` and upload the zip file to Moodle before the deadline. Make sure to only upload the source files above. **Do not submit any other files**. There should only be the 8 files above in the zip archive. Please check carefully that the correct files have been submitted. We suggest you to download your submitted files, extract them, and check for correctness. Do not submit any other files from the `A1.zip`. **You will receive 0 marks for this assignment if you submit incorrect files**. Resubmission after the deadline is not allowed.

##Deadline
The deadline is 23:55 Oct. 11. **No late submission will be accepted.**

##Late Submission
You will receive 0 marks if you submit after the deadline.

##Wrong Submission
You will receive 0 marks if you submit incorrect files.

#Task 1
Available marks: 0/100 (This is just to get you familiar with the autograder)

Write a C++ program that will read a string supplied by the user and output `Hi ` followed by the string that was entered. E.g. if the string

```text
Michael
```

was entered, then the program outputs the following.

```text
Hi Michael
```

We are going to implement this simple program to learn how to use the tester.

Open `1.cpp` and inspect the code.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {

}
```

Press `F6` to compile and run the file. You will see the following output.

```text
Press any key to continue ...
```

The program doesn't really do anything. Let's change that. Type the following code and save it in the file `1.cpp`.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  string name;
  cin >> name;
  cout << "Hi " << name << endl; 
}
```

Press `F6` to compile and run. Type `Michael`. You should see the following.

```text
Hi Michael
Press any key to continue ...
```

We are now going to use two test cases to check the correctness of this implementation.

##Test Cases

1_1

<pre>
<font color="blue">Loretta</font>
Hi Loretta
</pre>

1_2

<pre>
<font color="blue">George</font>
Hi George
</pre>

Note that input from the user is shown in <font color="blue">blue</font>. The first test case is identified by `1_1` and the second test case by `1_2`. You may read `1_1` as `task 1 test case 1` and `1_2` as `task 1 test case 2`. To receive full marks for a task you must pass all test cases. Passing all tests may not be sufficient to receive full marks.

Let's investigate how the tester determines if you pass a test case. Open the file `1_1.txt` in the folder `input`. You should see the following content.

```text
Loretta
```

Now, open the file `1_1.txt` in the folder `expectedOutput`. You should see the following content.

```text
Hi Loretta
```

The automatic testing system will use the content of the file `input/1_1.txt` as input to `1.cpp` and compares the output of `1.cpp` with the content of the file `expectedOutput/1_1.txt`. If and only if the output of `1.cpp` is identical to `expectedOutput/1_1.txt`, then you pass the first test case.

Let's now check if we pass the test cases. Open `test.cpp` and press `F6`. The tester prompts for task number. Enter `1` to select task 1. You will see the following output.

```text
1_1: PASSED
1_2: PASSED
```

Congratulations. You passed both test cases.

You may further change `1.cpp` and omit the last `<< endl`. Notice that you will not pass the tests if you are missing a newline in your output. The same is true for other invisible characters like spaces. If there are too many or too few you won't pass the test case.

Let's now see what happens if we don't pass a test case. Change the `1.cpp` as follows.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "I hear and I forget, I see and I remember. I do and I understand." << endl;
}
```

Save `1.cpp`, open `test.cpp`, press `F6`. Again, enter `1` to let the tester know that you want to test task 1. You should see the following output.

```text
1_1: FAILED
1c1
< I hear and I forget, I see and I remember. I do and I understand.
---
> Hi Loretta
1_2: FAILED
1c1
< I hear and I forget, I see and I remember. I do and I understand.
---
> Hi George

```

Let's go over this output line by line. The first output line

```text
1_1: FAILED
```

tells us that we failed task 1 test case 1. The following lines

```text
1c1
< I hear and I forget, I see and I remember. I do and I understand.
---
> Hi Loretta
```

describe the differences between the output of your program and the expected output. We are describing these differences to you in a prescriptive context: how to change the output of your program to the expected output.

Consider the first line of the description of the difference.  

```text
1c1
```

In general, this will contain

* line numbers corresponding to the output of your program,
* a letter (`a` for add, `c` for change, or `d` for delete), and
* line numbers corresponding to expected output.

So in this case we should modify our program `1.cpp` so that line 1 of its output is changed to match line 1 in the expected output. Note that the output of your program can be found in the file `yourOutput/1_1.txt` and the expected output can be found in the file `expectedOutput/1_1.txt`.

Let's continue with the description of the difference. Lines preceded by a `<` are lines from your output and lines preceded by `>` are lines from the expected output. The three dashes `---` merely separate the lines of your output and expected output.

To get a better understanding of the difference description, change `1.cpp` to the following.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  cout << "I hear and I forget, I see and I remember. I do and I understand." << endl;
  cout << "I still don't understand" << endl;
}
```

Open `test.cpp`, press `F6` and select the first task. You should see.

```text
...
1,2c1
...
```

instead of

```text
...
1c1
...
```

This tells us that lines 1 and 2 of our output have to be changed to line 1 of the expected output.

Let's do another test and remove all output in `1.cpp`. You will get

```text
...
0a1
...
```

which tells us that we should add line 1 of the expected output to line 0 of our output.

Now that you have a good understanding of the tester, you are ready to work on Task 2.

#Task 2
Available marks: 5/100

Write a C++ program that will read an integer supplied by the user. If a value in `{0, 1, ..., 17}` is entered the program outputs `junior`.  If a value in `{18, 19, ..., 64}` is entered the program outputs `adult`. If a value in `{65, 66, ..., 99}` is entered the program outputs `senior`. You may assume that the user only enters values in `{0, 1, 2, ..., 99}`.

##Test Cases

2_1

<pre>
<font color="blue">18</font>
adult
</pre>

2_2

<pre>
<font color="blue">17</font>
junior
</pre>

2_3

<pre>
<font color="blue">0</font>
junior
</pre>

2_4

<pre>
<font color="blue">64</font>
adult
</pre>

2_5

<pre>
<font color="blue">65</font>
senior
</pre>

Once you have solved this task, open `test.cpp`, press `F6` and select the second task. You should see the following output.

```text
2_1: PASSED
2_2: PASSED
2_3: PASSED
2_4: PASSED
2_5: PASSED
```

Good job! You have passed all five test cases for task 2.

#Task 3
Available marks: 10/100

Write a C++ program that will read three integers supplied by the user and output the sum of their factorials. You may assume that the user only enters values in `{0, 1, ..., 9}`. For example, if the user enters `7`, `4` and `9` the program outputs `367944`, because `7!+4!+9! = 367944`.

Note that the factorial of zero is defined to be one, i.e., `0! = 1`.

##Test Cases

#Task 7
Available marks: 25/100

Write a C++ program that plays the first four moves of Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts & Crosses). Initially, the program should output an empty board

```text
123
456
789
```

and then prompt

```text
x:
```

to indicate that it is waiting for user input from the `x` player. Please note that there is a trailing space in the output above, i.e., you should output "x: &nbsp;"  instead of "x:". The user will enter a value in `{1, 2, ..., 9}` to select their first move. The board will be updated accordingly. For example if the player selects `8` the program should output

```text
123
456
7x9
```

The program should then prompt

```text
o:
```

to indicate that it is waiting for user input from the `o` player. Again, there is a trailing space. The user will enter a value in `{1, 2, ..., 9}` to select their move. The board will be updated accordingly. For example, if the player enters `9` the program should output

```text
123
456
7xo
```

The program should then output

```text
x:
```

etc., until 4 moves have been played (i.e., two moves by `x` and two moves by `o`). Note that an invalid selection, e.g., of the `o` player above will output the same board again without changes and prompt the `o` player again.

#Task 8
Available marks: 10/100

Write a C++ program that will prompt the user for two positive integers `a`,`b`. You may assume that the user will always input positive integers such that the following holds `0 <= a < b < 1000`. The user will then be prompted for two divisors. You may assume that divisors entered by the user are valid, for which the following holds, `1 <= divisor < 1000`.

The program will then output a matrix with the following elements.

* The first row will start with an `M` followed by the two divisors in input order.
* The first column, beneath the `M`, will contain the integers between `a` and `b` (including `a` and excluding `b`), in increasing order.
* For the remaining two elements of each row, there will be a `1` if the integer in that row is divisible by the divisor at the head of that column, otherwise `0`.
* Matrix elements should be separated by a space. Note that there is no trailing space after the last element of a row.
